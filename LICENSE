The license of this repository is somewhat complicated. The TLDR is that the
author believes that the code contained here is as a whole non-free, but it is
still usable for creating free software.

DISCLAIMER: The author is not a lawyer and the following does not constitute
legal advice. Consult your own lawyer if you are unsure.

The SVD files and file fragments found in the svd/ directory originally came
from Silicon Laboratories. There was no explicit license agreement attached to
them, which means that there was also no explicit license grant.

The files under svd/ have been modified from the original files from
Silicon Laboratories. These modifications are licensed under the
public-domain-equivalent "zero-clause BSD license" below.

The files not under svd/ are new code. These files are all licensed under the
public-domain-equivalent "zero-clause BSD license" below.

The author is of the opinion that the svd2rust tool will extract only the
noncopyrightable facts from SVD files. Therefore, the author believes that,
although this repository is non-free, the output produced as a result of running
the code in this repository is not non-free.

However, note that the SVD files contain short textual descriptions of registers
and fields. These will be embedded as comments in the generated code. The author
believes that these short descriptions are still noncopyrightable facts.
However, stripping the comments from the output of this tool might be safer.

Finally, the crate generated by running this tool is generated using svd2rust.
The output code contains fragments of template code and might be subject to the
license of the svd2rust tool (MIT or Apache). The author believes the resulting
crates are indeed subject to the svd2rust license.
